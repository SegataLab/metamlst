# MetaMLST #
A computational pipeline for MLST typing from metagenomic data

MetaMLST is a software tool that performs an *in-silico* Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) Analysis on metagenomic samples. MetaMLST achieves cultivation- and assembly- free strain level tracking and detects all the species to which the standard MLST protocol is applicable.

### What can I use MetaMLST for? ###

* Strain level identification
* Microbial population analysis

### How it works? ###

MetaMLST works by reconstructing the MLST loci-sequences using the closest reference from the publicly available datsets (PubMLST) and traces the most abundant strain of each species:
